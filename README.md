# Competitive Programming

This repository contains solutions to competitive programming problems from various platforms, including **USACO**, **Codeforces**, **AtCoder**, and a dedicated section for **Segment Tree** and common problems related to it. The goal is to organize solutions to different problems, track progress, and share this with the programming community.

---

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into four main folders:

1. **USACO** contains solutions for problems from the [USACO](https://usaco.org/) contests.
   - The **General** folder includes introductory problems in Competitive Programming.
   - The **Bronze** folder covers a wide range of topics such as introduction to data structures, simulation, complete search, sorting and sets, greedy algorithms, graphs, rectangle geometry, and some additional practice.
   - The **Silver** folder includes problems related to more advanced topics like prefix sums, sorting and searching, two pointers, binary search, and graphs.

3. **Codeforces** contains solutions for problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). The problems are organized by difficulty (div) and contest number.

4. **AtCoder** contains solutions for problems from [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/). The problems are organized by contest.

5. **Segment Tree & More** is dedicated to problems related to the **Segment Tree** data structure, a key technique for efficiently solving range queries and updates. Additionally, this folder includes other common algorithms and techniques used in competitive programming.

## Setup and Usage

To work with the solutions in this repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/alejobaenam/Competitive-Programming.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Desired Folder
Go to the folder for the platform you're interested in (e.g., USACO, Codeforces, etc.):
```
cd Competitive-Programming/USACO
```

### 3. Compile and Run Code (Example for C++)
For C++ solutions, compile and run them as follows:
```
g++ problem_name.cpp -o problem_name
./problem_name
```
Replace problem_name.cpp with the file you want to run.
